          "A token calculator is very important because it provides any individual the ability to evaluate their current or future holdings at various price intervals. It is intended to ease the user in creating a reasonable entry and exit strategy. Both entry and exit strategies are one of the most daunting tasks for any investor. At the Cyber Enterprise, we cannot stress the importance of investment strategy and risk mitigation enough. Having one's emotions dictate their decision-making skills in the heat of the moment is a fault many succumb to. Ensuring our investors maintain level-headedness and have the proper tools in doing just that, is a task we do not take lightly.",
