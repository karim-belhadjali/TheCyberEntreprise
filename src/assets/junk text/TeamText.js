My goal is to revolutionize the token space and use it for what I believe it was intended for. A place to gather like-minded people and develop something truly special that will find its home on the blockchain, and fortify itself in history.Besides working on the project, I also enjoy other pastimes like keeping up with the political and financial system, as well as observing global events play out through a macro lens.

            "The name is Mihai but I go by Tease within the Enterprise. I joined the project back in at the end of August and started getting involved in September. The concept intrigued me and the way the Developer presented themselves is what made me want to get involved. I don’t sugarcoat anything and I didn’t when I first started interacting with Odysseus and ONI. I was critical in areas that I knew I would improve, and to my surprise rather than being on the defense like most projects, they welcomed it with open arms.  I’ve been coding for over 20 years, starting back in 2000 with websites. Over the years this would develop further into Branding, Speed Optimization, SEO, Data Scraping, White-Hat Hacking (against security threats), Improving CTR, and General Traffic. I like cooking old foods and trying old recipes, something your grandma would make. The peace that presents itself outside of the city is something I love, the days feel longer. If I were to do something besides coding, it would be teaching and mentoring the younger generation. The power of knowledge, I believe, is the key to having a better quality of life. I may be biased on this thought, but that’s the truth in my case. ",

In addition to this, I also aim to assist in the growth of the community by brainstorming with the team on what is the best approach we can take. In addition to this, my main task is being a mod to ensure everyone within the community is civil and so there is no misunderstanding within our Cyber fam. During my spare time, I mainly enjoy watching shows, and playing games (shout out to all the pc and console gamers out there, much love to you! And of course to everyone else) as it is my main pastime. In addition to this, I also do enjoy going out to watch movies, long drives to nowhere or having stay-cations with friends, and also traveling whenever I can or if the wallet allows me to do so.

Ensuring digital security is of utmost importance to me. I’ve worked in the data center industry for roughly 20 years, exposing me to all sorts of malicious ways attackers try to steal information and harm not only people but companies alike. From the very beginning, the open dialogue, transparency and willingness to not only hear, but implement others' views pulled me in. To put it simply, the people I engaged with inside the project felt like family, and as I do with my own, I wanted to ensure that everyone was kept safe.  Experiencing our diverse planet is something I enjoy doing. This includes going on road trips with friends (preferably in a fast car), trying out new foods, and taking pictures on these adventures to share with others. Additionally, I do enjoy video games. In the past, I have helped with events such as Gamescom, localized events, and offered consulting to indie game developers. With any of my pastimes, the thing I enjoy most is the interaction with people from all backgrounds and establishing new relationships. ",
