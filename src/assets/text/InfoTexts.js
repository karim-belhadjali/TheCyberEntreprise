            "The concept behind the Cyber Enterprise was to create a token without expiration, remaining indefinitely on the blockchain no matter what global events take place. A token not on the blockchain is something merely imitating a token and thus not a cryptocurrency. The blockchain is what provides credibility to investors, amongst other things. We strive to create a series of decentralized applications with the Cyber (CYBR) token having a place in everything we create. We knew we wanted the token to have multiple use cases, and therefore a token with a low supply was not our intent. We wanted a token with a limited supply, but for this initial amount to be enough to span multiple ecosystems and thus use cases. There will never be more of the Cyber (CYBR) token on the market.",

The token can now be purchased on UniSwap V3, ShibaSwap, won through giveaways, or earned through future internal reward systems, such as locking and liquidity providing. A CYBR (CYBR) token to USD pair is not available at this time, but a CYBR/ETH pair is. Ethereum can be bought with USD or other fiat currencies such as EUR through a centralized exchange.",

A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange secured by a blockchain-based ledger. A token is a form of a cryptocurrency, however, the main difference between for example ETH and any ERC-20 token such as the  Cyber (CYBR) token is that ETH is native to the Ethereum blockchain by default. An ERC-20 is a standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens, or virtual currencies. There are other forms of ERC Tokens, but the ERC-20 standard is specific to being fungible, the other standards are for now NFT(Non-Fungible Token) based.",

Either the token creator can choose to destroy the tokens entirely, which influences the price of a token instantly, but can also feed instability when the liquidity pool is not sufficiently big enough - causing even bigger price swings. The other way is placing tokens into a wallet/storage from which they cannot be withdrawn effectively creating a new slightly higher stable price floor every time a token is burned. ",
